# How to Send A File Through Direct Message
As a student, when working on a group project, you may be required to share files with each other. Although this seems trivial and can be done in many ways, Slack provides a streamlined process in which this can be done so that your file sharing and communication can happen all in one place.

In this section you will create a new direct message (DM) and send a file to one of your colleagues.
## Steps to Sending a File Through a DM
